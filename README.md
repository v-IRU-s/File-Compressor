# File-Compressor
This C++ project demonstrates the compression algorithm and is implemented using Huffman coding and File Handling

This project has 2 codes, one name compressor_str considers a whole word i.e string for building the tree , whereas other one named compressor_char considers characters of words for building tree.
Tree build by strings takes a little less space as compared to characters as word  is considered as a whole but the zip(text) file created still takes more space than actual/priginal file.
Any suggestion(s) would be helpful.
Thankyou.
I hope you have a great day !!
